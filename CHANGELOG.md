## 🧩 Version 1.0.0 — Initial Release (2025-10-14)

### 🚀 Overview
The first stable release of **Super RNN**, an advanced artificial intelligence engine written in pure C for security analysis on **Kali Linux** systems.  
This release introduces the **core RNN architecture**, **Adam optimizer**, and **AI-powered system threat analysis**.

---

### 🧠 Core Features Implemented
- **Custom Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** implemented entirely from scratch in C  
- **Forward & Backward Propagation (BPTT)** with Mean Squared Error loss  
- **Adam Optimizer** with momentum, velocity, and adaptive learning rates  
- **Xavier Weight Initialization** for stable gradient flow  
- **Early Stopping** to prevent overfitting  
- **Dropout Regularization** for improved generalization  
- **Data Normalization & Denormalization** for consistent training  

---

### 🔐 Security & System Analysis
- **Configuration File Analysis:** `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/group`, etc.  
- **Log Analysis:** `/var/log/syslog`, `/var/log/auth.log`, etc.  
- **Command Learning:** Learns common Linux utilities  
- **Threat Prediction:** Estimates system threat level (LOW–MEDIUM–HIGH)  
- **Automated Reporting:** Generates detailed reports in `/tmp/security_report.txt`  

---

### ⚙️ System Integration
- **System Data Collection:** From `/etc`, `/proc`, `/var/log`  
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** CPU, memory, and disk usage  
- **Command Execution:** Learns and executes Linux commands for analysis  
- **Report Generation:** Creates structured security summaries  

---

### 🧰 Build & Execution
- Compatible with **Linux-based systems (tested on Kali Linux)**  
- Compiles using `gcc` with optimization flags:  
  ```bash
  gcc -O3 -Wall -Wextra -o super_rnn super_rnn.c -lm
```


Executable modes :

  ```bash
./super_rnn
sudo ./super_rnn
  ```
  
  
📄 Output Example

Displays training progress (loss values per epoch)

Shows predicted vs. target outputs

Reports system security level

Confirms saved report path

🧾 Dependencies

Standard C libraries (math.h, stdlib.h, stdio.h, etc.)

Linux system files (/proc, /etc, /var/log)
